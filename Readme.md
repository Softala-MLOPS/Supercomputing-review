This repository is part of MLOPS project's documentation, the repository of the original project can be found here: https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform <br></br>

This repository consist of four parts:

- [Summaries](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/Supercomputing-review/blob/main/Summary.md) of these notebook files for easier learning experience<br></br>
- [Markdown files](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/Supercomputing-review/tree/main/Markdown%20Files) converted from the notebook files for easier reading experience<br></br>
- [Installation instructions](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/Supercomputing-review/blob/main/Simplified%20instructions%20for%20OSS%20Platform.md) for OSS-MLOPS-PLATFORM CLI-tool<br></br>

## Where to get started
If you want to get an overview of the notebook files and topics that are covered in them, start from the summaries. The installation instructions are for setting up the OSS-MLOPS-PLATFORM CLI-tool, which is used in the notebook files. The markdown files are converted from the notebook files for easier reading experience. We have also included [installation](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/Supercomputing-review/blob/main/Installation.md) file for setting up the kind cluster and Kubeflow/KFP installation, which can be useful because the current situation with the notebook files is that the installation instructions (that start from part 5) are inadequate.

Finally, the reviews contain feedback on the notebook files and suggestions for improvements. The revviews can be useful for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the notebook files and for getting ideas for further study. If you are interested in the development of the original project, the reviews can also provide insights into the user experience and potential areas for improvement.
