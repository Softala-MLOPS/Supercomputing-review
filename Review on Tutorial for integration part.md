This review covers the tutorials on integrating distributed computing in MLOps. There are 6 parts.

- [Move to part 1](#part-1)
- [Move to part 2](#part-2)
- [Move to part 3](#part-3)
- [Move to part 4](#part-4)
- [Move to part 5](#part-5)
- [Part 6](#part-6) coming soon!

# Part 1 (estimated time: 4h + 2,5h)

[Link to part 1](https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform/blob/studying/tutorials/integration/studying/tutorial_for_integration_part_1.ipynb)

## Summary

- Defining concepts being used and the terminology behind every important concept
- Tells the meaning behind the documentation
- Explained why Python was chosen as the coding language
- Explaining the use of JupyterLab
- Explaining the use of Pydantic
- Docker setup

## What works

Huang:
- Defining concepts at the start clearly (Allas, Mycsc account etc.)
- Specific versions of dependencies mentioned in case of problems and solutions to them
- Examples of dictionaries

Jukka:
- The lists of separated systemintegrations and enviroment tools are really good
- The conclusion to choose certain technologies (for example Python) were clearly justifyed in the document
- Examples of usage of technologies in the document were good
-  

## Suggested improvements

Huang:
- Perhaps naming the hyperlinks? (The useful links)
- Small typos like "cloud enviroment"
- Commands highlighted
- If abbreviations are used, would be nice to be included in the defining part
- If there is time, screenshots or guidevideos usually help visually, especially to complete newbies

Jukka:
- Naming could be done on the links in the notebook file of the useful material lists
- The examples aren't completely clear in every step
- Simplified and more visual presentations or animations could work for the data scientist who are going to be using these platforms
- We could have a hierarcical view of the technologies and the correlations between them

# Part 2 (estimated time: 1h)

[Link to part 2](https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform/blob/studying/tutorials/integration/studying/tutorial_for_integration_part_2.ipynb)

## Summary
- Explanation of FastAPI and how Submttier and Kubernetes Forwarder communicate through the Uvicorn server
- Explanation of the FastApi logs, application file structure and important parts of the fastApi. Document also tells how APIRouters and their routes work
- Docker Compose explained and how to use it
- Redis explained and how to use it
- Examples of using the created/stored Redis pickled data 

## What works
Jukka: 
- How to check localhost and the fastapi logs is valuable help
- Explaining of the fastapi is done very well. The important parts list is good
- Examples of how to use the commands are clear
- The entire document is much more clearer than the first one because there are fewer new technologies and the correlation between everything is much more clearer

## Suggested improvements
Jukka:
- The examples could include videos and animations
- Summary of the most important things in the end of the document
