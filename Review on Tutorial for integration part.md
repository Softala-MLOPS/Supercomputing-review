# Part 1

[Link to part 1](https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform/blob/studying/tutorials/integration/studying/tutorial_for_integration_part_1.ipynb)

## What works

Huang:
- Defining the terms and concepts at the start clearly (Allas, Mycsc account etc.)
- Specific versions of dependencies mentioned in case of problems and solutions to them
- Examples of dictionaries

## Suggested improvements

Huang:
- Perhaps naming the hyperlinks? (The useful links)
- Small typos like "cloud enviroment"
- Commands highlighted
- If abbreviations are used, would be nice to be included in the defining part
- If there is time, screenshots or guidevideos usually help visually, especially to complete newbies
