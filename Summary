# Summary
This document contains summaries written by Jukaleki and Tiriele in in the autumn semester of 2025. Summaries are based on the notebook files created in the original repository's studying section. The original directory with the notebook files can be found [here](https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform/tree/studying/tutorials/integration/studying).<br></br>
This summary is created to give a quick overview of what each part of the tutorial contains.<br></br>

## Part 4
[notebook source](https://github.com/K123AsJ0k1/multi-cloud-hpc-oss-mlops-platform/blob/studying/tutorials/integration/studying/tutorial_for_integration_part_4.ipynb)<br>
[markdown source](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/Supercomputing-review/blob/main/Markdown%20Files/tutorial_for_integration_part_4.md)
- Apache Airflow is used as a platform to programmatically monitor workflows. We can also create and schedule the workflows with it.
- The workflow blueprint are called DAGs and they are run similarly to kubeflow pipelines. When the workflow develops, we can modity the Submitter and Forwarder automation by modifying the DAGs.
- TriggerDagRUnOperator is a operator that we can use to create a complex DAG that triggers smaller DAGs by defining the sub DAGs.
- Hooks in Airflow are high-level interfaces to external platforms that remove the need to write low-level code.
- Most of the documentation is showing the logs and code in practice that is necessary for the creation of the Airflow integration.
